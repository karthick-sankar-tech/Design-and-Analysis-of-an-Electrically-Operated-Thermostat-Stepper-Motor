# Design-and-Analysis-of-an-Electrically-Operated-Thermostat-Stepper-Motor
This document presents the design and analysis of a compact, electrically operated thermostat stepper motor using a PMSM approach, specifically tailored for automotive applications. The motor is engineered to operate at low voltages (9–12 V DC) and deliver high torque (2.5–4 N·m) within a small 60 mm cubic form factor.
